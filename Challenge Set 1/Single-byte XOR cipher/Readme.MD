Here we had to score each ascii character as we xored it through the encrypted message and see which character got the highest score such that after xoring it diplayed the correct decrypted message by checking total number of characters that were valid characters. That character was stored as the valid single byte and the message decrypted using xoring that character with every byte from the message was the correct decrypted message.
